[Em]We three kings[B7] of Or[Em]ient are;
[Em]Bearing gifts, [B7]we trave[Em]rse afar,
[Em]Field and [D]fountain[G], moor and mountain,
[Am]Following[B7] yond[Em]er star.

P:
[D7]O, sta[G]r of wonde[C]r, star [G]of night,
St[G]ar with roya[C]l bea[G]uty bright,
W[Em]estward[D] leadin[C]g, still [D7]proceeding
G[G]uide us to th[C]y per[G]fect light.

Born a King on Bethlehem's plain,
Gold I bring to crown Him again,
King forever, ceasing never
Over us all to reign.

Glorious now behold Him arise,
King and God and Sacrifice;
Alleluia, Alleluia!
Peals through the earth and skies.
