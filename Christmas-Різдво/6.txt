O come, all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant;
O come ye, O come ye to Bethelehem.
Come and behold Him, Born the King of angels;

O come, let us adore Him,
Christ the Lord!

Sing, choirs of angels, sing in exultation;
Sing, all ye citizens of heaven above:
"Glory to God, all glory in the highest!"

Yea, Lord we greet Thee, Born that happy morning;
Jesus, to Thee be all glory given.
Word of the Father, now in flesh appearing:
