I've w[E]andered far aw[A]ay from G[E]od, now I'm coming h[H7]ome;
The p[E]aths of sin too l[A]ong I've tr[E]od, Lord, I'm c[H7]oming h[E]ome.

P:
Coming home, c[A]oming home,
N[E]evermore to r[H7]oam,
[E]Open wide Thine [A]arms of l[E]ove,
Lord, I'm c[H7]oming h[E]ome.

I've wasted many precious years, now I'm coming home;
I now repent with bitter tears, Lord, I'm coming home.

I'm tired of sin and straying, Lord, now I'm coming home;
I'll trust Thy love, believe Thy Word, Lord, I'm coming home.

My soul is sick, my heart is sore, now I'm coming home;
My strength renew, my hope restore, Lord, I'm coming home.

My only hope, my only plea, now I'm coming home;
That Jesus died, and died for me. Lord, I'm coming home.

I need His cleansing blood, I know, now I'm coming home;
O wash me whiter than the snow, Lord, I'm coming home.
