Wh[Am]at Child[C] is this [G]who, l[Em]aid to rest
On[Am] Mary'[F]s lap [E]is sleeping?
Who[Am] An[C]gels gree[G]t with [Em]anthems sweet,
Whi[Am]le shephe[Em]rds watc[Am]h are keeping?

P1:
T[C]his, this i[G]s Christ [Em]the King,
Who[Am] sheph[F]erds gu[E]ard and Angels sing;
[C]Haste, haste,[G] to brin[Em]g Him laud,
Th[Am]e Babe, th[E]e Son[Am] of Mary.

Why lies He in such mean estate,
Where ox and ass are feeding?
Good Christians, fear, for sinners here
The silent Word is pleading.

So bring Him incense, gold and myrrh,
Come peasant, king to own Him;
The King of kings salvation brings,
Let loving hearts enthrone Him.

P2:
Raise, raise a song on high,
The virgin sings her lullaby.
Joy, joy for Christ is born,
The Babe, the Son of Mary
