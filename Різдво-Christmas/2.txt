From God our heavenly Father
A blessed angel came,
And unto certain shepherds
Brought tidings of the same,
How that in Bethlehem was born
The Son of God by name.

"Fear not, then," said the angel,
"Let nothing you afright;
This day is born a Savior
Of a pure virgin bright,
To free all those who trust in Him
From Satan's power and might."
