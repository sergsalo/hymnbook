Pleased as man with men to dwell, Jesus, our Immanuel
Hark the herald angels sing, "Glory to the new born King"

Hail! the heaven-born Prince of Peace. Hail the son of Righteousness
Light and life to all He brings, risen with healing in His wings
Mild He lays His glory by, born that man no more may die
Born to raise the sons of earth, born to five them second birth
Hark the herald angels sing, "Glory to the new born King"
