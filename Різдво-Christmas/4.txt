I[G]t cam[C]e up[G]on a midnight clear
That[C] glorio[A7]us song[D7] of old
From[G] ange[C]ls ben[G]ding near the earth
To t[C]ouch the[D7]ir harp[G]s of gold
"Peac[B7]e on the earth,[Em] good will to men
From[D] heave[A7]n's all gr[D]acious King;"
The [G]world i[C]n sol[G]emn stillness lay,
To h[C]ear the[D7] angel[G]s sing

Still through the cloven skies they come
With peaceful wings unfurled,
And still their heavenly music floats
O'er all the weary world
Above its sad and lowly plains
They bend on hovering wing;
And ever o'er its Babel sounds
The blessed angels sing.

O ye, beneath life's crushing load
Whose forms are bending low,
Who toil along the climbing way
With painful steps and slow
Look now! for glad and golden hours
Come swiftly on the wing;
O rest beside the weary road
And hear the angels sing
