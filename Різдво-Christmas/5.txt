[C]O holy night, the star[F]s are brightly shinin[C]g;
[C]It is the night of the d[G]ear Savior's b[C]irth.
L[C]ong lay the world in s[F]in and err[C]or [C7]pining,
Till he app [Em]eared and the so [B]ul felt its wo[Em]rth.
A[G] thrill of hope, the weary soul[C] rejoices,
For[G] yonder breaks a new and gl[C]orious morn.
[Am]Fall on your knees,[Em]
Oh,[Dm] hear the angel v[Am]oices!
O[C] ni[G]ght [C]di[F]vine,
O [C]night when Chris[G]t was born! [C]
O [G]ni[G7]ght, O[C] ho[Dm]ly ni[C]ght, O night d[G]ivine![C]

Led by the light of faith serenely beaming,
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand.
O'er the world a star is sweetly gleaming,
Now come the wisemen from out of the Orient land.
The King of kings lay thus lowly manger;
In all our trials born to be our friends.
He knows our need, our weakness is no stranger,
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend!

Truly He taught us to love one another,
His law is love and His gospel is peace.
Chains he shall break, for the slave is our brother.
And in his name all oppression shall cease.
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we,
With all our hearts we praise His holy name.
Christ is the Lord! Then ever, ever praise we,
His power and glory ever more proclaim!
