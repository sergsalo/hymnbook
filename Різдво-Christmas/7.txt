O l[D]ittle town [Em]of Bethlehem,
How[D] still w[A7]e see t[D]hee lie;
Ab[D]ove th[B7]y deep a[Em]nd dreamless sleep
The[D] silent[A] stars g[D]o by.
Y[D]et in the[Em] dark stree[F#]ts shineth
The[Bm] everl[G]asting[F#] light;
The [D]hopes and f[Em]ears of all the years
A[D]re m[D]et in t[A]hee t[D]onight.

For Christ is born of Mary;
And gathered all above,
While mortals sleep the angels keep
Their watch of wondering love.
O morning stars together
Proclaim the holy birth;
And praises sing to God the King,
And peace to men on earth.

How silent, how silently
The wondrous gift is given!
So God imparts to human hearts
The blessings of His heaven.
No ear may hear His coming,
But in this world of sin,
Where meek souls will receive Him still,
The dear Christ enters in.
