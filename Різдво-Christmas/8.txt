[C]Silent night, holy night
[G]All is calm[C], All is bright
[F]Round yon V[C]irgin, Mother and Child
[F]Holy Infan[C]t so Tender and mild,
[G]Sleep in heav[C]enly peace,
[C]Sleep in[G] heave[C]nly peace.

Silent night, holy night
Shepherds quake at the sight,
Glories stream from heaven afar,
Heavenly hosts sing Alleleulia
Christ the Saviour is born!
Christ the saviour is born.

Silent night, holy night
Son of God, love's pure light
Radiant beams from Thy holy face
with the dawn of redeeming grace,
Jesus Lord at thy birth,
Jesus Lord at thy birth.
