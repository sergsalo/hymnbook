The[C] First N[G]oel, [F]the Ang[C]els did say
Was [C]to certain [G]poor she[F]pherds in f[C]ields as they lay
In [C]fields wh[G]ere the[F]y lay keep[C]ing their sheep
On [C]a cold win[G]ter's nig[F]ht tha[C]t was so deep.
No[C]el, N[G]oel,[F] Noel[C], No[G]el
[C]Born is th[G]e King[C] of[G] Israel!

They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the East beyond them far
And to the earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night.

And by the light of that same star
Three Wise men came from country far
To seek for a King was their intent
And to follow the star wherever it went.

This star drew nigh to the northwest
O'er Bethlehem it took it's rest
And there it did both Pause and stay
Right o'er the place where Jesus lay.

Then let us all with one accord
Sing praises to our heavenly Lord
That hath made Heaven and earth of nought
